## What I did
I own a Spotify Premium Account for several years now, and I add songs to my personal playlist that I really like and would like to listen to in the near future.
This behaviour comes with the big drawback that my playlist got veeeeeery long and I actually don't listen to all the songs in the playlist.

Recently, I had the idea that I would like to save only the songs I like to listen to lately in my personal playlist, and outsource the other ones from this playlist to another playlist.

Thus, I developed a short but lovely algorithm that takes the songs from my playlist that were added long ago and move those songs to another playlist. 
This way, I do not lose any songs I once listened to but keep my current favorite songs in my playlist.   

## How it works
